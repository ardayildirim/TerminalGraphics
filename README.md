# TerminalGraphics
Rotating cubes,donuts etc.

### Usage:
Does not work on Windows, works on Linux \
  + You can use ```make all``` for compiling with g++ and running the executable. \
 ```make build``` will build the project with the executable ```Terminal.out``` \
Once you run the executable, it will tell you the scenes, type "1" etc. to run the scene.

### Requirements/Dependencies:
None. I only used standard library.
