Rotating 3D shapes, started from cubes and donuts. Now can show and translate/rotate .off files. 
___
### Usage:
  + CMake: \
  Type ```make init``` for the first time. After first time you can use ```make all``` for compiling, output file will be named main.out

  It should work on Windows too, with or without CMake. You need to compile it yourself though.
